# ADIDAS-SALES-DASHBOARD
Power bi Dashboard
Project Description:

As part of the Adidas Sales Dashboard project, I designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard was aimed at providing in-depth analysis of Adidas's sales performance across various regions, channels, and product categories. I integrated and processed sales data from multiple sources using SQL, ensuring high data accuracy and consistency. The project involved creating dynamic reports and visualizations that allowed stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue growth, sales trends, and product performance in real time.

Key Insights:

Regional Sales Performance:

Identified that North America was the highest-grossing region, contributing to 45% of total revenue, while the Asia-Pacific region showed the highest growth potential with a 15% increase in sales year-over-year.
Product Category Analysis:

Discovered that footwear accounted for 60% of overall sales, with a significant spike in sales for the running shoe segment, which saw a 20% increase compared to the previous quarter
